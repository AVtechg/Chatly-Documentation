                                Rich messages are special messages with interactive features like buttons, dropdowns, or inputs.
                                They allow an agent to request information from the user via a user input form or to diplay interactive contents.
                                Rich messages can be inserted into a chat message using shortcodes. Shortcodes accept various parameters like title and description.
                                The available rich messages are listed below.

                                An agent is a special user that can log in to the admin area and reply to all of the conversations.
                                There are two types of agents: Agents.
                                Admins are the only ones that can create new Agents; they also have access to the settings area.
                                Agents can only manage users and conversations.

                                users enter into a queue automatically when an agent's chat limit is reached.
                                When a user enters the queue, a message with the current position in the queue and the estimated waiting time is displayed.
                                Chatly  automatically assigns the conversations to all available agents proportionately.
                                When an agent marks a conversation as completed (by archiving it), the queue is updated and a new conversation is received.

                                    Agents must archive a conversation to mark it as completed; this will automatically give them access to the next conversation in the queue.

                                    Agents can switch their status between online and offline by hovering over their profile image and then clicking the label of the profile pop-up at the bottom-left of the admin area.

                                <li>

                                    The waiting time is displayed in minutes and is calculated as follows: queue position X response time = waiting time. For example, if a user is 5th in the queue, and the response time has been set to 4 minutes (via Settings &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Queue), then the total wait time displayed to the user will be 20 minutes.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If a user is in the queue and leaves (e.g. by closing the browser) for more than 1 minute, the conversation is saved;
                                    however, once the user comes back, the queue is reset and the user will lose their previous position.
                                    If the user leaves, the conversation remains unassigned and therefore invisible to agents, but only visible to admins.

                                <li>
                                    To enable agents to view all unassigned conversations, activate <b>Settings &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Hide conversations of other agents</b> and <b>View unassigned conversations</b>.

                                    For conversations started from messaging apps like WhatsApp, it is not possible to respect the limit of conversations per agent, all conversations will be immediately and proportionally assigned to an agent.

                                    Email attachments are supported.

                                    In order for email piping to work, email replies must contain the Chatly  recipient's name. Ex. <b>Chatly  | SB2457-4734 &lt;example@email.com&gt;</b>.
                                    All major email clients like Outlook Web, Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, support the recipient's name by default via chatbot reply or reply all buttons.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Because of the nature of how emails work, each email client uses their personal codes, delimiters, and automatic strings, and more.
                                    For this reason, some chat messages converted from emails can contain invalid texts.
                                    We are working to optimize as many email clients as possible, for now, the following email clients are optimized and should not return any invalid text: Outlook Web, Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo Mail.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Email piping supports departments, if the user's conversation is assigned to a department, the email notifications are sent only to the agents assigned to that department.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If the email includes the <b>reply-to</b> attribute, it will serve as the primary user email address and notifications will be sent to that email.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                    You can create a cron job that runs the URL <b>[SUPPORT-BOARD-URL]/include/api.php?piping=true</b>. Use the command <b>*/59 * * * * wget [SUPPORT-BOARD-URL]/include/api.php?piping=true</b> to run it via a command.
                                    Replace <b>[SUPPORT-BOARD-URL]</b> with your Chatly URL.
                                    To obtain the URL, follow these steps:<br>
                                    If you are using the WP or PHP version, go to <b>Settings &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Chatly URL</b>.
                                    If you are using the cloud version, use this URL: <b>https://cloud.7HpdAJAu7qCU.support/script/include/api.php?piping=true&amp;cloud=API-TOKEN</b> and replace API-TOKEN with your own API Token which can be found at https://cloud.7HpdAJAu7qCU.support/account/?tab=installation.

                                    You can also use this cron job file: <a target="_blank" href="files/cron.zip">download</a>. The cron job command is <b>php -f YOUR-FILE-PATH/cron.php</b>.

                                    If you manually run the cron job, check the setting <b>Disable cron job</b> to stop Chatly from manually triggering it and to improve performance.

                                Activate Pusher from <b>Settings &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Pusher</b> to use the WebSockets instead of HTTP AJAX requests for the chat functionalities.
                                WebSockets drastically improve the chat performance by removing the need for repeated AJAX requests to your server for checking for new messages and conversations.
                                WebSockets also improve responsivness of the chat: faster messages delivery, more accurate online and typing status, more accurate online users list and more.

                                Push notifications are like Desktop notifications but with some key difference.
                                Desktop notifications, also called Web notifications, are requested directly by the client while Push notifications come from a server.
                                The main difference is that the Push notifications work always, also if your device is offline, or Chatly  is not open.
                                Also, they are persistent and always visible until closed.
                                Push notifications require an external service to work. We use Pusher, it is free to use for the admin notifications sent to the agents, and it's free to use for up to 2000 users/devices when sending notifications to the users.

                                    It will require some time for your chatbot to consistently provide correct answers to all questions.
                                    To improve its performance, you and your human agents should continuously train the chatbot by incorporating new question variations and Intents.
                                    This approach will effectively enhance the capabilities of your chatbot.
                                </li>

                                    Agents can add new Intents and chatbot responses, and add new training phrases to existing intents on the fly from the admin area by moving the
                                    mouse cursor over a message and clicking the Dialogflow Intent icon.
                                    Enable <b>Settings &gt; Artificial Intelligence &gt; OpenAI &gt; Generate user expressions</b> to automatically add variations of the question and to rewrite the answer.
                                    New Intents will contain also the responses, while the update of existing intents will add new training phrases only, but not new chatbot responses.
                                    If you're using Dialogflow CX, the chatbot responses will be added to the latest flow used in the conversation if any, otherwise to the start flow.

                                    If the chatbot is replying with the wrong intents, go to <b>Dialogflow Console &gt; chatbot Settings &gt; ML Settings</b>, and set the <b>ML CLASSIFICATION THRESHOLD</b> to a larger number, such as 0.6.

                                When searching for a matching intent, Dialogflow scores potential matches with an intent detection confidence, also known as the confidence score.
                                These values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain).
                                Specify a value ranging from <b>0.1</b> to <b>1.0</b>. Any answer provided by Dialogflow that is less than this value will not be considered.
                                If you are utilizing Dialogflow alongside your OpenAI chatbot that is trained using your resources, it is recommended to configure the value as <b>0.81</b>.

                                Knowledge Base are automatically enabled. Knowledge Base is a feature that gives your chatbot the ability to search within documents (such as a PDF) or web pages to find an answer.
                                To create your first Knowledge Base, go to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/knowledge-connectors">cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/knowledge-connectors</a>

                                The full Dialogflow <b>JSON</b> response is automatically saved in the database, <b>sb_messages</b>, column <b>payload</b>.

                            <p>
                                Sometimes Dialogflow gives incorrect answers due to similar questions with different subjects.
                                To solve this, you can instruct Chatly to ignore an Intent if specific keywords are not present in the user's message.
                                Here's how you can do it:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="icon-list icon-line icon-docs">

                                    Enter Dialogflow and edit the Intent.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    For each training phrase, select the keywords you want to be required and link them to a new <b>Entity</b>, or an existing one.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Under <b>Actions and parameters</b> check <b>Required</b> and add a new <b>Prompt</b> with value <b>skip-intent</b>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Save the Intent. <a href="../media/docs/dialogflow-skip-intent.jpg" class="docs-picture lightbox" data-lightbox-anima="fade-in"></a>

                                User attachments are sent to Dialogflow by appending the attachments to the message details in the following format:
                                </p><pre>[name:file-name.ext,url:URL,extension:file-extension]</pre>
                                Example:

                            <p>
                                To allow the chatbot to send attachments, add a <b>Custom Payload</b> response and insert this JSON code:
                                </p><pre class="prettyprint lang-json">                                    { "attachments": [["name", "YOUR-LINK"], ["name", "YOUR-LINK"], ["name", "YOUR-LINK"]]}
                                </pre>
                                Replace "name" with the actual name of the attachment to display and replace "YOUR-LINK" with the actual URL of the file.
                                Images attachments are displayed automatically as images.
                            <p></p>

                                To allow Dialogflow to send <a href="#rich-messages" class="scroll-to">rich messages</a>, simply enter the rich message shortcode into the <b>TEXT RESPONSE</b> field or add a new <b>Custom Payload</b> response and insert this JSON code: <b>{ "rich-message": "shortcode" }</b>.
                                Replace "shortcode" with the rich message shortcode, to have a valid JSON code you need to replace all <b>"</b> chars with <b>\"</b>.

                            <p>
                                When the user interacts with rich messages via the Chatly  chat (e.g. by clicking a button),
                                the rich message response is sent to Dialogflow in the following format:
                                <b>ID|response</b>, or <b>ID</b> if the rich message type is registration, email, follow up, in this case the rich message values are sent as array in the <b>queryParams['payload']</b> key.
                                <b>ID</b> is the rich message ID, which can be set by adding the attribute id="YOUR-ID" to the shortcode. If no ID has been set, a random ID will be used instead.
                                <b>response</b> is the input or selection of the user.
                                To block Dialogflow from replying to a rich message add a new intent with <b>ID</b> as the only user expression and no response.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If the user is interacting with the chatbot via a messaging app (e.g. WhatsApp),
                                the response of the rich message does not contain the rich message ID and Dialogflow <b>contexts</b> must be used to allow Dialogflow to understand which Intent to activate for a specific rich message response.
                            </p>

                                The OpenAI chatbot feature functions similarly to Dialogflow, providing automated responses to user messages.
                                Select the <b>Chatbot mode</b> setting to specify the questions that the chatbot is capable of responding to.
                                Utilize the <a href="#human-takeover" class="scroll-to">human takeover</a> feature to enable the chatbot to redirect the chat to a human agent as necessary.

                                The fallback message is sent when OpenAI is unable to understand the user question.
                                If the Dialogflow chatbot is enabled, the fallback message will be turned off and the Dialogflow chatbot's fallback message will be utilized instead.

                                This prompt instructs OpenAI on how to rewrite a message when the <b>Message rewrite button</b> is active.
                                This prompt should be in English. Chatly automatically add the following text when required: <b>and use the user langauge, add greetings</b>.

                                If you choose to activate the human takeover feature, you need to include a particular phrase in your query to prompt OpenAI to respond with <b>I don't know</b> if it is unable to provide an answer to the user's question.
                                For example you can use: <b>Respond "I don't know", if not sure about the answer</b>.

                            <h4>Dialogflow spelling correction</h4>
                            <p>
                                In the case where Dialogflow is unable to find the appropriate response to the user's message, this function verifies if there are any spelling errors.
                                If any such errors exist, Dialogflow is prompted again with the correctly spelled version of the message for an accurate response.
                                Although it has a higher priority, this feature can still work together with the Google Search spelling correction feature.
                            </p>

                                This feature adds a button to the text field of the conversation area, click on it to rewrite your message and make it more friendly and professional.
                                Greetings will be added automatically if there is no previous agent messages.
                                If your language is not English, you have to edit your agent/admin profile and set the correct language.

                                When this option is active, OpenAI will generate new user expressions in real time when you open the <b>Dialogflow Intent</b> window by clicking the <b>Send to dialogflow</b> menu item of a message in a conversation.

                                When you click the button <b>Generate user expressions</b>, openAI will update your Dialogflow agent and generate new user expressions for each Intent.
                            </p>

                                    This task can take several minutes or even hours if your chatbot has a lot of Intents.
                                    Since the operation takes a long time, your server may interrupt the operation (operation timeout) before it finishes, in which case you need to click the button again.
                                    You can verify if the operation is interrupted by checking the browser console for errors.

                                    You can provide the website URL and all the pages will be crawled, but with large websites, it is more efficient and less prone to errors and infinite link loops to utilize an XML sitemap instead of relying on the website URL.
                                    You can create it with a service like <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.xml-sitemaps.com</a>.

                                    If you want to train your chatbot using specific pages from your website instead of all of them, you can make use of an XML sitemap.
                                    Create one using a tool like <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.xml-sitemaps.com</a>, and then remove the pages you do not wish to include by editing the file in a text editor.
                                    To use the XML sitemap, you need to upload it either onto your server or an external online location.
                                    Afterward, add the URL of the sitemap in <b>Settings &gt; Artificial Intelligence &gt; OpenAI - Training sources</b>.

                                    To activate this feature, go to <b>Settings &gt; Artificial Intelligence &gt; OpenAI &gt; Multilingual Training Sources</b>.
                                    For Chatly to comprehend the language of your web pages, the <b>&lt;html&gt;</b> must contain the attribute <b>lang</b>.

                                    As soon as the training is completed, the uploaded files are removed.
                                    Every time you need to retrain the chatbot, you are required to upload all the necessary documents for its training once again.

                                    Please note that the ADA Embedding model is different from the ADA model and is available at a much lower cost.

                                    If Dialogflow is enabled, OpenAI may not work correctly because your Dialogflow agent does not have the Fallback Intent. Please verify its presence on the Intents page, and if it's missing, you can create it again by following the instructions <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/intents-default" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
                                    To quickly check if this is the issue, you can disable Dialogflow and send a message consisting of 2-3 words. Then, check if the browser console has errors.

However, you can still implement them using the Chatly API and Webhooks. For more details, visit https://7HpdAJAu7qCU.support/docs/api/web
                                Please be aware that you must possess coding skills as a developer to proceed with this task. Additionally, our default integrations are equipped with advanced features including chatbot support, automated messages, human takeover, WhatsApp rich messages, attachments, and more. Consequently, although setting up a basic integration for sending and receiving text messages is relatively straightforward, ensuring its flawless functionality is a more intricate process.

                                If you wish, you have the option to hire us; however, we are available only for developing a basic integration that enables two-way text messaging and attachments.

                            <p>
                                A WhatsApp message template is a message format that you can use over and over again to message users once they have opted-in and given your app permission to send them messages.
                                You can not Enter the original message into the template, you must use it to notify the user of a new message and instruct him on how to view it,
                                for example by providing a link to your website where the chat is shown.
                            </p>

                                    In case you encounter duplicated messages or an ongoing chat cycle between the chatbot and Instagram messages, you are facing a problem due to the presence of two Chatly installations or
                                    Chatly Cloud accounts that are both synchronized with the same Instagram account.
                                    To resolve this, access the second Chatly admin area, navigate to <b>Settings &gt; Messenger &gt; Facebook pages</b>, remove the <b>Instagram ID</b> value and save the changes.

                                    Make something to trigger a webhook like sending a message, or creating a new user, then go back to Zapier and click <b>Test Trigger</b> and you should see the Chatly  webhook data. Click <b>Continue</b>.

                                    Click the right button <b>Filters</b> and set up the filter in order to trigger the integration only if a variable exists.
                                    You need the filter because Chatly  will send all webhooks to all zaps.
                                    Example: if your zap wants to integrate the messages of Chatly , you will need to set the filter to continue only if the variable <b>message</b> exists.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    To use multiple zaps and webhooks you will need to update <b>Settings &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Webhooks &gt; URL</b> and add the new zap IDs, separated by commas.
                                    Example: if you have two zaps with URLs <b>https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/10352851/bbad21f/</b> and <b>https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/10352851/aaaa66t/</b>, the URL must be <b>https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/10352851/bbad21f,aaaa66t/</b>.

                            <p>
                                Security is critical here at Chatly. We work with security experts who perform periodic security audits.
                                We continually implement the latest security technologies and stay up-to-date on the latest security threats.
                                Find below some of the security measures that have been implemented in Chatly.
                            </p>
                            <h4>IP ban</h4>
                            <p>
                                The Chatly permits a maximum of 6 unsuccessful login attempts within an hour.
                                If a user exceeds this limit, they will be barred from accessing their account for a duration of 1 hour.
                                This blocking mechanism is based on the user's IP address and serves to deter brute force attacks aimed at uncovering login credentials.
                            </p>
                            <h4>XSS injection protection</h4>
                            <p>
                                To prevent XSS injection protection attacks, all sensitive user inputs undergo sanitization.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Active sessions termination on user update</h4>
                            <p>
                                Whenever the password or the details for an admin or agent is changed, all active sessions are automatically logged out when sensitive operations are executed or after 1 hour.
                            </p>
                            <h4>AES-256-bit encryption</h4>
                            <p>
                                We use 256-bit AES encryption to encrypt sensitive data such as active session login data.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Password by filename protection</h4>
                            <p>
                                Chatly ensures that all uploads are renamed with a random alphanumeric string prepended to the original file name to prevent discovery of the URL and unauthorized download of the uploaded file.
                                Kindly note that, for this feature to function properly, your server must prohibit directory listing.
                            </p>
